    <h1>Top 10 Terrifying Horror Movies üîÆ</h1>
    <h1 style="color: aliceblue; ">Horror movies have a dedicated fanbase, but they're not the best-represented genre in the film world. Thankfully, through the wonders of the internet, fans of horror flicks can access a wealth of scary content without much work.
Of course, there are plenty of horror movies on services like Netflix, but those require a paid subscription. When you're looking for free scares or just want to laugh at a cheesy old horror movie with friends, here's where you can watch horror movies for free online, legally.</h1><br><br>

    <h1 style="color: aliceblue;">3. ANABELLE</h1>
    <h1>Before The Conjuring, there was Annabelle. Capable of unspeakable evil, the actual Annabelle doll exists locked up in an occult museum in Connecticut -- visited only by a priest who blesses her twice a month. In this supernatural thriller from producer James Wan, Annabelle's story begins before the evil was unleashed.</h1>
    <h1>John Form (Ward Horton) thinks he's found the perfect gift for his expectant wife, Mia (Annabelle Wallis) : a vintage doll in a beautiful white dress. However, the couple's delight doesn't last long: One terrible night, devil worshippers invade their home and launch a violent attack against the couple. When the cultists try to summon a demon, they smear a bloody rune on the nursery wall and drip blood on Mia's doll, thereby turning the former object of beauty into a conduit for ultimate evil.</h1>

    <h1 style="color: aliceblue;">4. EVIL DEAD</h1>
    <h1>In 2013, director Fede √Ålvarez rebooted the franchise with Raimi, Campbell, and Tapert as producers. This reimagining of the story sees five new Michigan State students visiting a cabin in the woods. Recovering addict Mia (Jane Levy) is joined by her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez), and their friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas), Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore). As with the first two incarnations of this story, only one survives. This time, it's Mia.

        This film focuses more on the perspectives of the victims possessed by the evil dead than those who fight it. Although the lore of the world remains consistent with the originals, this film portrays it in a much less campy way. The color palette is practically black and white, and everything is played seriously, even when the plot becomes as absurd as the originals.</h1> 
        <h1>Much like Ash in Evil Dead II, Mia loses a hand and uses her stump to carry the chainsaw she wields. It's implied the movie is establishing Mia as the reboot's replacement for Ash; however, a post-credits scene reveals Bruce Campbell returning to say his trademark "groovy." It is clear the plan was to somehow merge the two worlds, making both canon, but Mia and the other characters of 2013's Evil Dead have yet to reappear in the franchise.</h1>
